I am an \[incoming\] Ph.D. student in the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah. My research interests fall in the broad union of networked systems and applied data management techniques. I am part of the [Flux Research Group](https://www.flux.utah.edu/) and the [Data Management Research Center for Human-centered, Efficient, and Scalable Systems](https://mod.cs.utah.edu/), where I am very fortunate to work with [Dr. Anna Fariha](https://afariha.github.io/) and [Dr. Jacobus Van der Merwe](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~kobus/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
